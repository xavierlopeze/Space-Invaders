# space-invaders
Space Invaders game developed in Java.

This game has been fully developed by Xavier López as an assigment of the class "Advanced Programming", Bachelors degree in Mathematis at UAB.

## Getting Started
In this repository there are two java projects:
	-Space Invaders
	-Space Invaders2

The difference between those two projects is that the first is a java application, and the second is a java applet.
	The "Space Invaders2" project could (or should) be a branch of the same project, however I prefer to keep them separated at the moment.
	Java applets are not very used nowadays, however it has let me show my project to the world very easily, the game is public in xavierlopeze.github.io. Please not that this public java applet does not use any resources like images or sound, in contrast to the projects presented in this repository.

Please note that "SpaceInvaders.zip" file is just a copy of the folder "Space Invaders".
